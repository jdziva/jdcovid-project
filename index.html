<h1>Omicron</h1>
<p>Omicron is more transmissible than Delta and—as it did in the U.S.—it will likely become the predominant variant in most places. What is less known is what makes it more transmissible and how quickly it will rise to dominance around the world. 

One concern is that more than 30 of Omicron’s mutations are on the virus’s spike protein, the part that attaches to human cells, and several of those are believed to increase the probability of infection. So, part of its enhanced transmissibility may come from its ability to evade some immune responses, especially in individuals who were previously infected but not vaccinated. 

Very early reports from South Africa showed cases rising rapidly from 300 a day to 3,000 a day over a two-week period.

Severity: Not yet clear. Early cases identified among people in South Africa were mild, but most of the diagnoses were in young people.

Can vaccination prevent it? It is not yet clear how effective the vaccines in the U.S. will be against Omicron. The first person in the U.S. to be diagnosed with the variant was fully vaccinated, and the second had also received a booster shot. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports there is early evidence that vaccinated people who are infected with Omicron will be able to spread it to others. 

Some preliminary laboratory data shows that antibodies generated from vaccines are less effective at neutralizing Omicron, though booster shots help to restore some of that loss. It is expected that vaccine effectiveness against Omicron infections will decrease, though not completely, while effectiveness against severe disease will be better maintained. The companies that produce the three vaccines available in the U.S. are working on Omicron-specific ones to prepare in case they are needed.
